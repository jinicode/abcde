I'm a final year Computer Engineering undegrad student at D.J. Sanghvi College of Engineering. I am very passionate about developing softwares with a goal-driven creative mindset.

Outside work, I occasionally learn about new technologies and frameworks to keep myself updated.

I also love cosmology🌌 and particle physics ⚛️ .
