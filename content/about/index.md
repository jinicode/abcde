Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of Physics-Maths in my high school and got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [DJ Sanghvi](https://www.djsce.ac.in/). Since then, I started developing Web and ML projects, and pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2018-2022) with [9.54 CGPA]().

I also have past internship experience at various organizations and have participating in hackathons.

I was also the runner-up at Code-for-Good hackathon by JP Morgan Chase.

Here is a list of the technologies that I have worked with !
